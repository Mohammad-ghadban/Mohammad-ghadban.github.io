## Welcome to my applicataion web page

### Why

Throughout my years of study and work I have always **loved** coding and thinking about programs, unfortunately I wasn't able to study coding the right way.
with you I am trying to have a chance to infuse my *passion* with the lines of *code* I am about to learn. 

### How

Using the time I have, working hard, following the dream I have always sought, and by the guidance of your teachings.

### What

It was really hard chosing the right field for me, but in the end the back end development was the closeset to my heart and soul.
learning what I miss, asking quistions and finding solutions will improve my knowledge and hopefully oneday I would return the favor and contribute in the scince of programming
