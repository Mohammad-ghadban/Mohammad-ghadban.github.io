## Introduction to CSS Part1

Let’s review what you learned so far:

* The basic anatomy of CSS syntax written for both inline styles and stylesheets.
* Some commonly used CSS terms, such as ruleset, selector, and declaration.
* CSS inline styles can be written inside the opening HTML tag using the style attribute.
* Inline styles can be used to style HTML, but it is not the best practice.
* An internal stylesheet is written using the \<style> element inside the \<head> element of an HTML file.
* Internal stylesheets can be used to style HTML but are also not best practice.
* An external stylesheet separates CSS code from HTML, by using the “.css”.file extension.
* External stylesheets are the best approach when it comes to using HTML and CSS.
* External stylesheets are linked to HTML using the \<link> element.
* Take this knowledge to the next lesson, where you start learning how to select HTML elements to style!
