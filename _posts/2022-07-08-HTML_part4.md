## Introduction to HTML Part4

Let’s review some of the topics we covered throughout the lesson:

* Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
* Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen readers to translate the webpage and improves your website’s SEO.
* \<header>, \<nav> , \<main> and \<footer> create the basic structure of the webpage.
* \<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
* \<article> holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
* \<aside> contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in order to understand the dominant information.
* \<figure> encapsulates all types of media.
* \<figcaption> is used to describe the media in \<figure>.
* \<video>, \<embed>, and \<audio> elements are used for media files.

          <p>New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.</p>
