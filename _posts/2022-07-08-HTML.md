## Introduction to HTML

Review
Congratulations on completing the first lesson of HTML! You are well on your way to becoming a skilled web developer.

Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
* Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
* HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
* Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
* Headings and sub-headings, \<h1> to \<h6> tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.
* \<p>, \<span> and \<div> tags specify text or blocks.
* The \<em> and \<strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
* Line breaks are created with the \<br> tag.
* Ordered lists \<ol> are numbered and unordered lists \<ul> are bulleted.
* Images \<img> and videos \<video> can be added by linking to an existing source.
